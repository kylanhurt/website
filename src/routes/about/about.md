## One-paragraph description

Wharf is a complete framework of intuitive and reliable developer tools for building web-based apps on Antelope blockchains. Wharf’s modular and user-focused code packages make it easy to turn your idea into reality — whether you want to create a wallet, mint NFTs, design a DeFi protocol, or build something entirely new.

## Tagline

Shipping great code starts with a solid platform. (?)

## Vision

We envision a world where Antelope chains thrive as a hub for innovation and creativity, where developers have the tools to build any web-based project they can imagine on the blockchain.

## Mission

Wharf aims to simplify the developer experience on Antelope chains by providing developers with high-quality modular software development kits that can be adapted for any Web3 project.

## Who the brand speaks to

## Key differentiator

Wharf is the first fully developed SDK for Antelope web apps. (I’m not fully satisfied with this, so other differentiators or ways of phrasing this would be helpful)

## Personality

Engaging teacher. One description we kept coming back to was a “good classroom vibe,” where you’re learning and being empowered to do things, and having fun while you’re at it. Wharf meets you where you are, and encourages you to go further and try new things.

## Tone of voice

Accessible, empowering, reliable.
